Hi, this is a project I did as a hobby to learn a little about python and pyGame, I also made some pixel art for the game, it isn't anything specal, but feel free to use it :)
You can find this projet in the book Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes
